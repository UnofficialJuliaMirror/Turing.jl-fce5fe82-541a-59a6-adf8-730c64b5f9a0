# Editing the Documentation Site

The Turing site is broken into two different folder structures:

- `docs/src` contains all the _content_ of the site. This is where any markdown (`.md`) file is located. When the site is built, the files in this directory are run through `Documenter`, as well as some Turing-specific pre and postprocessing to get LaTeX and YAML headers correct. The folder structure here mimics that of `docs/site`.
- `docs/site` contains anything related to the _structure_ and _appearance_ of the website. You can find all the webpage formatting, site configuration, and navigation configuration files here.

Should you need to add a new document to the documentation section or the tutorials section, this needs to be changed in the file `docs/site/_data/navigation.yml`.

# Building the Documentation Site Locally

The documentation site is built by Travis and served from the `gh-pages` branch of this repo. If you wish to edit the website
locally and review your changes, you will need to do the following:

1. Install Jekyll by following [the relevant guide](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) for your operating system.

2. Install Julia by following [the relevant guide](https://julialang.org/downloads/). 

3. Navigate in a terminal to `Turing.jl/docs/`. Run `julia make.jl`, then you'll get a `docs/build` folder full of documents. You might need to install `Documenter` and `DocumenterMarkdown` first. You can install these packages by running `julia -e 'using Pkg;Pkg.add("Documenter");Pkg.add("DocumenterMarkdown");Pkg.build()'`.

4. Navigate in a terminal to `Turing.jl/docs/site`.

5. Type `jekyll serve` if you wish to review the changes in a browser. Typically the website will be served on `localhost:4000`,
which you can visit in your browser.

6. Alternatively, if you simply want to build the site files into a static site, you can use `jekyll build`.

The files in `docs/site` may be out of date with the website. If this is the case, execute the `make.jl` script found
at `Turing.jl/docs/make.jl`, which will run all the documents in the `docs/src` folder through a markdown processor and place
them into the `docs/site/` folder. Any files located in the `docs/site/_docs/` or `docs/site/_tutorials/` directories
should **not** be edited directly, as they will be overwritten by the versions in the `docs/src/` directory. Edits must
be made to the `docs/src/` versions.

## MacOS Notes
Under MacOS one might need to install the following additional gems's to have jekyll running as descibed above.

```
gem install jekyll-paginate
gem install jekyll-sitemap
gem install jekyll-gist
gem install jekyll-feed
gem install jemoji
```

Note: I guess these packages should be installed automatically, but were not in my case.
